So we can get ask this last wrap up done quickly as possible for phase one I've spilt content into three: beetle is all the stuff not including INTRO NEWS or PLAY NOW.
I've tried to be specific hence the length, so there is no ambiguity and hopefully it'll be a simple matter to go through, complete. Done for a long long time to come!


Rollcall
--------

- [x] List roll call names with those with a patron above those without
- [ ] List roll call with active players at the top by preference
- [ ] Guild, city and order rolls should be header linking to appropriate WORLD page, graphic alongside short blurb, suggest founding text. Order with a link to that deity HELP page though ideally would be nice to have a similar header with a graphic for each deity and their fiIrstintro text (I have these) and their in-game help after active followers

History
-------
- [ ] What you have as modern affairs needs to move from news into history. Timeline and Godline should be bragging here cross kinked if possible. Ideally this content suitors be flexible liked the Intro and News sections to reduce need for further coding at html level once initial but is done. Check Avalon HELP for content but figure the player memoirs and history legend stuff would all be better here. This will also reduce the HELP GUIDE section load a little.
- [ ] **IDEA**: could we have a click against a player in roll call options SEND MESSAGE, go-to meetplace profile, and include their creation date as per history file. Avalon can provide all this info in any format most easy.

Front Page:
-----------

- [ ] Swap UMBRA and telnet on footer ribbon so Umbra is far more prominent with more clear click here/ Umbra browser client / optimised for you!
- [ ] All left side words on the top black strip need to be consistent i.e. Pull down menus. Help should be renamed Guide maybe so consistent with footer its pull down being the section list.
- [ ] Links to VOTING, SITEMAP, etc should all be new site.
- [ ] Include Google+ linking to avalongods@gmail.com and the Digg page Cornelius did so the social media links aren't so sparse.
- [ ] News should include the latest newsletter summary with link to full content, which is already in new site format.
- [ ] Latest events should go at the bottom immediately above the footerÂ 
- [ ] How hard to show the names too be clicked on to lead into their roll call entry? Likewise guild and city and deity to go to the appropriate page so everything is neatly cross referenced.



World:
------

- [ ] Need to know where the text is art the top so its content can be dynamic, changed by Avalon to include latest affairs between cities.
- [ ] This section should include AFFAIRS data again simply taken from a file Avalon keeps automatically up to date.
- [ ] No need to have so much spacer taken up by the four academies. Better the dynamic content as it will allure far more.
- [ ] Ensure what there is about the academies is cross linked with intro.
- [ ] Make sure each city has patron, Prince, cardinal and field marshal listed with blurb by flag cross linked to each individuals page of course!

General
-------

- [ ] Footer: replace maps with Timeline JK"
- [ ] **IDEA**: include the meeting place avatars for players in a directory to get used for their page roll call in large format and other places they might be referenced in thumbnail. This will look excellent I reckon and give players a real pride in their place on site.
- [ ] Error: The academy college institute and orphanage title text overlaps itself so looks bad. It had very strange rendition of the big graphic and ask the section titles at the bottom empty!
- [ ] Please also make sure PAGES section had been given a once over so ensure nothing had been missed (undress it's not part of this phase)
- [ ] Finally for this part of the phase concluding: can you make sure there is a HOW TO or a web page direct access only documenting exactly how to update ask text and title content i.e. all the written content generated by the game or in special text blocks by us. Again this means site content can be changed in simple cases without needing to burden webmaster.
