           p Avalon is the first text based game to invent the idea of player control, cities, guilds, unique skills and a sense of 'better than life' simulation of reality. Everything follows the rule of credibility.

           p Avalon remains since 1989 the most sophisticated online text based RPG, well beyond any graphical variation, to have so hundreds of abilities shared, hundreds for each profession, many professions to choose, each with their own style of play, all finely balanced. To list them would be as large as a dictionary of Sindarin by J.R.R. Tolkien.

           p Players may become masters of their class!

There are legion abilities based on their type, skill training, marching, 3D depth, trenches, tunnels, mines, mortars and archers, formations and far more against which no other warfare game online text based or graphical could compare.
